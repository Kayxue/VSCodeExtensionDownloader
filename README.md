A really simple application which can help you download extension from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)

## Motivation

Because download button of extensions on
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) is disappear, so I decide to make this application for easily downloading extensions from Visual Studio Marketplace;

2. Fill in informations about the extension you want to download
   ![Publisher and Extension Name](./publisher.webp)

![Version](./version.webp)

Or paste link from Visual Studio Marketplace, and click `Analyze` button to analyze publisher and extension name from URL, then fill in version by yourself
